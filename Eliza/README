#Eliza Chatbot

In order to chat with Eliza, load and compile the program into your preferred 
clisp environment (I used the Portacle IDE), and simply type what you would 
like to say to Eliza in the following format:

(eliza '(hello))


In the above example, "hello" can be replaced with any response you like.

The Portacle IDE can be retrieved from the following link:
